## fixed some issues with Hue installation

## create a folder /downloads in the root of the project
# download apache hadoop 3.4.1, apache hive 4.0.1 tarballs in the downloads folder
run docker-compose build
run docker-compose up



After starting your cluster with docker-compose up --build, you can access Hue in your browser at:
http://localhost:8888



Hue should automatically detect your HiveServer2 service through its internal network. 
If needed, you can configure Hue to use the correct HiveServer2 Thrift endpoint by 
editing hue/desktop/conf/hue.ini (mounted from ./hue/ on the host).

```editorconfig
[beeswax]
hive_server_host=namenode
hive_server_port=10000

```

# Where to see table details in hive metastore. Which database, which table 

Key tables in the Hive Metastore:

DBS: Contains information about Hive databases.
TBLS: Contains information about Hive tables.
SDS: Stores information about table storage descriptors.
COLUMNS_V2: Contains details about the table columns (schema).
PARTITIONS: Stores partition details if your table is partitioned.
BUCKETING_COLS: Information about bucketed columns (if used).

select * from public."DBS";
SELECT * FROM TBLS WHERE db_id IN (SELECT db_id FROM DBS WHERE name = 'sample_db');
SELECT * FROM COLUMNS_V2 WHERE cd_id IN (SELECT sd_id FROM SDS WHERE tbl_id IN (SELECT tbl_id FROM TBLS WHERE tbl_name = 'employees'));

SELECT * FROM TBLS WHERE db_id = (SELECT db_id FROM DBS WHERE name = 'sample_db') AND tbl_name = 'employees';
SELECT * FROM COLUMNS_V2 WHERE cd_id = (SELECT sd_id FROM SDS WHERE tbl_id = (SELECT tbl_id FROM TBLS WHERE tbl_name = 'employees'));
